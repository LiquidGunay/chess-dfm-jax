# Local GPU research path

The implementation contract is
[docs/local_gpu_autoresearch_plan.md](../docs/local_gpu_autoresearch_plan.md).

Before running local commands:

```bash
source research/env.sh
```

This creates and exports workspace-local locations for temporary files,
dependency caches, JAX compilation artifacts, data, checkpoints, profiles, and
experiment runs. The script refuses to configure itself if the repository is
outside `/mountpoint/.exp`.

The intended stable interface is:

```text
prepare.py        fixed data and asset validation
import_legacy.py  checksummed, restricted source-checkpoint boundary
train.py          single editable model/objective/training surface
inference.py      checked cached-BT4 multi-pass inference and profiling
arena.py          frozen pools, paired outcomes, and arena statistics
program.md        rules for automated research
results.tsv       compact append-only experiment ledger
```

All mutable state, including Python and JAX caches, remains below
`/mountpoint/.exp`.

The parity oracle is run separately:

```bash
research/run_gpu.sh .venv/bin/python research/legacy_baseline.py
```

It uses strict model-state restoration and writes a deterministic loss
fingerprint under `artifacts/baselines/`.

The first compatibility trainer is:

```bash
research/run_gpu.sh .venv/bin/python research/train.py --steps 1 --batch-size 1
```

`research/train.py` now owns the checkpoint-visible model, stage-1 objective,
optimizer, training step, and validation step. The legacy implementation is
used only as a test oracle; fresh runs cross `import_legacy.py` after exact
size, digest, serialization, and ABI checks.

For a checked-in experiment, edit the small `EXPERIMENT_OVERRIDES` mapping near
the top of `train.py`. Effective configuration precedence is:

```text
source checkpoint metadata -> EXPERIMENT_OVERRIDES -> explicit CLI flags
```

The final effective configuration is written to the report and bound into the
resume contract. Unknown keys, wrong types, and non-default legacy knobs that
the local graph cannot honor fail before training.

The harness remains intentionally marked `autoresearch_ready=false` while the
normalized objective and paired arena promotion gate are being frozen. See the
plan and baseline report for the measured A10G results and remaining gates.
